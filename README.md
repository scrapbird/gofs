gofs
====

Simple web server I use when I need to download files onto something quickly

Navigate to the directory you wan't to be the root of your web server and execute gofs.

The default port that gofs will listen on is 8888 but you can specify a different host string as a single parameter. In any of the following formats:
	host:port
	:port
	port
